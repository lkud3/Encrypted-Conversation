# Encrypted Conversation
Python Client-Server programs that exchange text messages via encrypted connection.

Basically, the server opens the port that the client can connect to. After that, an encrypted connection is established with the exchange of encryption keys and subsequent communication is made over an encrypted channel with the use of 3 algorythms: Diffie Hellman, RSA and AES.

The code was written as part of a coursework, not ideal so far and for now can not perform parallel communication between the server and the client, only serial sending of the messages. 

The report itself is on Russian, but I will add the English version soon as well.

P.S. Oriented for Linux Machine
